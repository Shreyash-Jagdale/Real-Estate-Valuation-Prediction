# Real-Estate-Valuation-Prediction
The Real Estate valuation is influenced by various factors. It is complex function of various economic factors, geographical factors, neighbourhood, Real Estate condition etc. The market historical data set of real estate valuation is collected from Sindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan. The data consists of deal prices of various houses under certain conditions characterized by attributes such as location, distance from metro station, house age, deal time and number of convenient stored available in neighbourhood. We have analysed the effect of each of these factors on the prices of houses and have tried to construct various regression models based on these factors and included models that were found significant.

Problem Statement:
Examining real estate valuation helps understand where people tend to live in a city. The higher the price, the greater the demand to live in the property. Predicting real estate valuation can help urban design and urban policies, as it could help identify what factors have the most impact on property prices. Our aim is to predict real estate value, based on several features.
Our objective is to:
1.	Understand the data available
2.	Test rapidly different regression models
3.	Assess the best model(s) and improve them
4.	Present the results and what could be further addressed.
